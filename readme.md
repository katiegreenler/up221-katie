## Overview
My name is Katie Greenler. I am a _second year MURP_ specializing in design and development. I like to focus my work on mobility, pedestrianism, green space, and overall on community centered design. I have a strong background in GIS, data visualization, and design. 

## Ideas & Objectives
I have taken a course similar to this, centered on HTML/CSS/Javascript and mapping, but am looking to gain a stronger coding foundation in Python as I feel that is more applicable in my work. I'd be happy to work on a project that touches on any of the interests mentioned above but am also open to working outside of my comfort zone. I look forward to creating a project that not only reflects my interests but helps my further develop critical skillsets!
